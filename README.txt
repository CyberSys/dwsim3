==================================================
SOFTWARE/SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
==================================================

OS: 	Windows XP/2000/Vista/7/8
Software: 	.NET Framework 4.0 / Mono 2.10 or newer
CPU: 	1.6 GHz single-core processor (minimum)
GPU (optional): 	CUDA 1.3+ or OpenCL 1.1-enabled device
Memory: 	1 GB RAM
HD space: 	200 MB for program files.
Display: 	A 1024x768 display resolution is recommended as a minimum.

==================================================
USAGE INFO (LINUX / OS X)
==================================================

** Linux

To run DWSIM on Linux, open a terminal (console) window, point it to the folder which contains the DWSIM executable and execute the following command:

mono DWSIM.exe

To run in debug mode, include the '--debug' switch (when you encounter an unhandled exception, debug mode will include information about the source code file and line number where the exception was raised - helps to track bugs):

mono --debug DWSIM.exe

In order to use the PC-SAFT Property Package, the Gibbs Reactor and the IPOPT solver, you'll need to copy the corresponding native libraries to your 'lib' folder (you'll need to do this only once) and rename 2 files in the DWSIM directory:

sudo cp sharedobjects\liblpsolve55.so /usr/lib/
sudo cp sharedobjects\libPC_SAFT_PROP.so /usr/lib/
sudo cp sharedobjects\libfprops_ascend.so /usr/lib/
sudo tar -C /usr/lib -zxvf sharedobjects\libipopt_mono_dwsim_ubuntu_11.10_32.tar.gz

mv DWSIM.exe.config.linux DWSIM.exe.config
mv Cureos.Numerics.dll.config.linux Cureos.Numerics.dll.config

On Linux machines, Mono can locate these libraries on the DWSIM folder, so you don't need to copy them.

** OS X

Important: Mono requires the X11 package installed on OS X in order to run Windows Forms applications, including DWSIM. Be sure to have it installed before doing the steps below.

Due to a bug in the libgdiplus library in OS X, DWSIM will work only with a specific Mono 2.10 build, which can be found here => https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2474

To run DWSIM on OS X, open a terminal (console) window (Go > Utilities > Terminal), point it to the folder which contains the DWSIM executable and execute the following commands:

export MONO_MWF_MAC_FORCE_X11=1
mono DWSIM.exe

To run in debug mode, include the '--debug' switch (when you encounter an unhandled exception, debug mode will include information about the source code file and line number where the exception was raised - helps to track bugs):

mono --debug DWSIM.exe

In order to use the PC-SAFT Property Package, the Gibbs Reactor and the IPOPT solver, you'll need to copy the corresponding native libraries to your 'lib' folder (you'll need to do this only once) and rename 2 files in the DWSIM directory:

sudo cp dynamiclibraries\liblpsolve55.dylib /usr/lib/
sudo cp dynamiclibraries\libgfortran.3.dylib /usr/lib/
sudo cp dynamiclibraries\libPC_SAFT_PROP.dylib /usr/lib/
sudo cp dynamiclibraries\libfprops_ascend.dylib /usr/lib/
sudo unzip dynamiclibraries\libipopt_mono_dwsim_osx_10.7.3_32.zip -d /usr/lib

mv DWSIM.exe.config.osx DWSIM.exe.config
mv Cureos.Numerics.dll.config.osx Cureos.Numerics.dll.config

Finally, if you didn't do this already, copy the file "default.ini" and rename the copied file to "dwsim.ini" to have your settings saved between sessions. 

==================================================
KNOWN ISSUES
==================================================

Known limitations of DWSIM when running on Mono:

- Report Tool doesn't work. When the user clicks on the button to generate a report preview, a blank page appears;
- DataGrids don't display tooltips, this is a Mono limitation, not DWSIM's.
