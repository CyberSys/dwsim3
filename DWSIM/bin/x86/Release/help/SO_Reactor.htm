<H2>Reactors</H2>

<p>The reactors in DWSIM are specialized modules that solve a particular set of reactions in
sequence or in parallel.</p>

There are four different types of reactors available:
<table style="margin-left:20px;">
<tr><td><b>Type   </b></td><td><b>Description</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>CSTR:   </td><td><b>C</b>ontinuous <b>S</b>tirred <b>T</b>ank <b>R</b>eactor</td></tr>
<tr><td>PFR:   </td><td><b>P</b>lug <b>F</b>low <b>R</b>eactor</td></tr>
<tr><td>Gibbs:   </td><td>Gibbs Minimsation Reactor</td></tr>
<tr><td>Equilibrium:   </td><td>Equilibrium Reactor</td></tr>

<br>
To run a simulation of a reactor it is necessary to define the chemical reactions which are to be used in this specific reactor.
This is done in simulation thermodynamic setup with the "Reaction Manager" (see separate documentation).<br>
The principle is to either define reactions of "Equilibrium", "Conversion" or "Kinetic" type. One or more reactions are combined to define
a "Reation Set" which is used for calculation of the reactor.

<h3>Input Parameters</h3>

All reactors share the same basic interface. There must be set the 
<ul>
<li><b>input and output streams</b></li>
<li><b>energy streams</b> that represent the heat exchanged with the environment</li>
<li><b>reaction set</b> to be used</li>
<li><b>mode of operation</b> (isothermal or adiabatic)</li>
<li><b>pressure drop</b> through the reactor.</li>
</ul>
<br>For the PFR and CSTR, it is also necessary to define<br>
<ul>
<li><b>volume</b> of the reaction medium</li>
</ul>
<br>For the Gibbs Reactor you select the calculation mode:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Diect Minimization: </b>Define components taking part in reactions and the element matrix.</li>
<li><b>Reaction Extend: </b>Select reaction set which defines extend of each reaction.</li>
</ul>

<br><br>
<h3>Output Parameters</h3>
As results the conversions of the components involved in the reactions, the variation in temperature 
and the heat exchanged in the reactor are shown.<br><br>

For the <b>PFR</b> the profiles of concentration of reactants and products (see figure) is shown along the
longitudinal axis of the reactor (assuming the concentration does not vary radially).<br><br>
