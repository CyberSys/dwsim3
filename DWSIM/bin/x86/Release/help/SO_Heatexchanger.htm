<H2>Heat Exchanger</H2>

<p>DWSIM has a model for the countercurrent, two-stream heat exchanger which supports phase
change and multiple phases in a stream.</p>

<h3>Input Parameters</h3>
The heat exchanger in DWSIM has five calculation modes:<br>

<ol>
<li>Calculate <b>hot fluid outlet temperature</b>: you must provide the cold fluid outlet temperature
and the exchange area to calculate the hot fluid temperature.</li>
<li>Calculate <b>cold fluid outlet temperature</b>: in this mode, DWSIM needs the hot fluid outlet
temperature and the exchange area to calculate the cold fluid temperature.</li>
<li><b>Calculate both temperatures</b>: in this mode, DWSIM needs the exchange area A and heat
exchanged to calculate both temperatures.</li>
<li><b>Calculate both temperatures_KA</b>: in this mode, DWSIM needs the exchange area A and heat 
exchange coefficient U to calculate both outlet temperatures and transfered heat.</li>
<li><b>Calculate area</b>: in this mode you must provide the HTC and both temperatures to calculate
the exchange area.</li>
<li><b>Rate</b> a Shell and Tube exchanger: in this mode you must provide the exchanger geometry
and DWSIM will calculate output temperatures, pressure drop on the shell and tubes,
overall HTC, LMTD, and exchange area. This calculation mode uses a simplified version
of Tinker’s method [1] for Shell and Tube exchanger calculations.</li>
</ol>

<br>You can provide the pressure drop for both fluids in the exchanger for modes 1 to 4 only.

<h3>Calculation Method</h3>
The heat exchanger in DWSIM is calculated using the simple convection heat equation:<br>
<img src="pictures/SO_Heatexchanger2.png"><br>

where: Q = heat transferred, A = heat transfer area (external surface) and &#916T<sub>ml</sub> = Logarithmic
Mean Temperature Difference (LMTD).<br><br>

We also remember that:<br>
<img src="pictures/SO_Heatexchanger3.png"><br>
where: Q = heat transferred from/to the fluid and DH = outlet-inlet enthalpy difference.<br>

<br>
The calculation procedure depends on the mode selected:<br>
<ol>
<li>Calculate hot fluid outlet temperature: HTC (Heat Transfer Coefficient), hot fluid outlet temperature, heat load and LMTD.</li>
<li>Calculate cold fluid outlet temperature: HTC, cold fluid outlet temperature, heat load and LMTD.</li>
<li>Calculate both temperatures: HTC, cold and hot fluid outlet temperatures and LMTD.</li>
<li>Calculate area: exchange area and LMTD.</li>
<li>Rate Shell and Tube exchanger: exchanger geometry information.</li>
</ol>

<br>
<h3>Results</h3>
The results given by the heat exchanger after calculation depends on the mode selected:
<ol>
<li>Calculate hot fluid outlet temperature: overall HTC, hot fluid outlet temperature, heat load and LMTD.</li>
<li>Calculate cold fluid outlet temperature: overall HTC, cold fluid outlet temperature, heat load and LMTD.</li>
<li>Calculate both temperatures: overall HTC, cold and hot fluid outlet temperatures and LMTD.</li>
<li>Calculate area: exchange area and LMTD.</li>
<li>Rate Shell and Tube exchanger: area, LMTD, LMTD correction factor (F), overall HTC, hot fluid outlet temperature, cold fluid outlet temperature, hot fluid pressure drop (shell/tubes only), cold fluid pressure drop (shell/tubes only).</li>
</ol>
