<H2>Pipe Segment</H2>

<p>The Pipe Segment unit operation can be used to simulate fluid flow process in
a pipe. Two of the most used correlations for the calculation of pressure drop are available in
DWSIM. Temperature can be rigorously calculated considering the influence of the environment.
<br>
With the help of the Recycle Logical Operation, the user can build large water distribution
systems, as an example.
The pipe segment is divided in sections, which can be straight tubes, valves, curves, etc. Each
section is subdivided in small sections for calculation purposes, as defined by the user.

<tr>
<td><b>Hydraulic profile: </b>clicking on the ellipsis button opens the pipe hydraulic profile editor. 
Here the user adds sections, defines their type and into
how many increments it will be divided during the calculations. Also the pipe material, length,
elevation, internal and external diameters are defined. Each change can be saved by clicking 
the "Apply" button.<br></td>

<tr>
<td><b>Thermal profile: </b>clicking on the ellipsis button opens the pipe thermal profile editor. 
In the thermal profile editor it is possible to define how the temperature profile in the
pipe should be calculated. The configurations in this window are valid for the entire pipe
segment. Changes are saved automatically.<br></td>

<h3>Calculation method</h3>
The pipe segment is calculated based on incremental mass and energy
balances. The complete algorithm consists in three nested loops. The external loop iterates
on the sections (increments), the middle loop iterates on the temperature and the internal loop
calculates the pressure.<br><br>

The pressure and temperature are calculated as follows:
<ol>
<li>The inlet temperature and pressure are used to estimate the increment outlet pressure and temperature.<br><br></li>

<li>Fluid properties are calculated based in a arithmetic mean of inlet and outlet conditions.<br><br></li>

<li>The calculated properties and the inlet pressure are used to calculate the pressure drop. 
With it, the outlet pressure is calculated.<br><br></li>

<li>The calculated and estimated pressure are compared, and if their difference exceeds the
tolerance, a new outlet pressure is estimated, and the steps 2 and 3 are repeated. <br><br></li>

<li>Once the internal loop has converged, the outlet temperature is calculated. If the global
heat transfer coefficient (U) was given, the outlet temperature is calculated from the following
equation:<br>
<center><b>Q =  U*A*&#916T<sub>ml</sub></b></center><br>
where: Q = heat transferred, A = heat transfer area (external surface) and &#916T<sub>ml</sub> =
logarithmic mean temperature difference.<br><br>
</li>

<li>
The calculated temperature is compared to the estimated one, and if their difference
exceeds the specified tolerance, a new temperature is estimated and new properties are
calculated (return to step 2).<br><br>
</li>

<li>
When both pressure and temperature converges, the results are passed to the next increment,
where calculation restarts.<br><br>
</li>

</ol>
