Always check if DWSIM has binary interaction parameters for the components in your simulation! Adequate binary interaction parameters are required by some thermodynamic models in order to obtain reliable results. 
Activation of DWSIM's Calculator doesn't mean that the streams will be automatically recalculated. For this to happen, you must perturb a modifiable variable in a material stream, i.e. modifying a stream's pressure from 200 to 200,01 kPa. 
Run the simulation more than once to ensure the correctness of the results obtained.
If the simulation's file already exists on your hard disk, a backup is made with the ".dwbak" extension. To use it again as a DWSIM simulation file, rename its extension to ".dwsim".
