Functions exposed by this AddIn will be grouped in a category named “DWSIM”:<br><br>

All DWSIM functions are one ore two dimensional <b><i>Matrix formulas</i></b> which may recognised by curly brackets: <b>{}</b>.<br><br>

This kind of formulas is entered in Excel in three steps as depicted in the following picture:<br>
<ol>
 <li>Enter formula into the first top left cell of the result range (A2). The formula doesn't contain the brackets now.</li>
 <li>Select the required result range (A2:A16) with top left cell highlighted.</li>
 <li>The formula needs to be modified into a matrix formula now. This is accomplished by editing the formula and finish editing 
by using <b><i>Ctrl+Shift+Enter</i></b></li>
</ol>


Property and Equilibrium calculation functions require parameters that must be one or more values which were 
returned by functions <b>GetPropPackList, GetCompoundList, GetPropList, GetCompoundPropList and GetPhaseList</b>.<br>

These formulas will return values listed in a single column:<br>

As an different example, the <b>PTFlash</b> function requires the name of the Property Package to use, the compound names 
and mole fractions, temperature in K, pressure in Pa.<br>

You may optionally provide new interaction parameters that will override the ones used internally by DWSIM.<br>

The calculation results will be returned as a two dimensional (n+2) x (4) matrix, where n is the number of compounds.<br>
First row will contain the phase names (Vapor, Liquid, Liquid2 and Solid, in this order), the second will 
contain the phase mole fractions and the other lines will contain the compound mole fractions in the corresponding phases:<br><br>

For PH, PS, TVF and PVF flash calculation functions, an additional line is returned that will contain the temperature in K or 
pressure in Pa in the first column.
